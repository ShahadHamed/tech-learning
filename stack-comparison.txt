Introduction:
A **stack comparison** involves evaluating different combinations of technologies used to build web applications, often referred to as “tech stacks.” Each stack typically includes a **front-end, back-end, and database**, and the choice of technologies affects **performance, scalability, development speed, and ease of maintenance**. Comparing stacks helps developers and organizations decide which combination best suits a project’s requirements, whether it’s for small-scale apps, enterprise systems, or real-time web applications. Popular comparisons include **MEAN vs. MERN**, **LAMP vs. Django**, or **Ruby on Rails vs. Node.js stacks**.

The MERN stack consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, using JavaScript across both front-end and back-end. It is highly suitable for real-time applications, single-page apps, and startups due to its asynchronous, event-driven architecture and ease of use for JavaScript developers. In contrast, the .NET stack uses ASP.NET Core with C# for the back-end, often paired with SQL Server and front-end frameworks like Angular or React. It is optimized for large-scale, enterprise-level applications, offering strong security, robust performance, and deep integration with the Microsoft ecosystem. While MERN is easier for full-stack JavaScript development and rapid prototyping, .NET is preferred for complex business systems requiring reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
