Introduction:
A **stack comparison** involves evaluating different combinations of technologies used to build web applications, often referred to as “tech stacks.” Each stack typically includes a **front-end, back-end, and database**, and the choice of technologies affects **performance, scalability, development speed, and ease of maintenance**. Comparing stacks helps developers and organizations decide which combination best suits a project’s requirements, whether it’s for small-scale apps, enterprise systems, or real-time web applications. Popular comparisons include **MEAN vs. MERN**, **LAMP vs. Django**, or **Ruby on Rails vs. Node.js stacks**.
