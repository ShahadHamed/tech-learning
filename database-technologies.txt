**Database technologies** are used to store, manage, and retrieve data for web applications.

* **MySQL:** A popular relational database that uses structured tables and SQL queries to organize data efficiently.
* **PostgreSQL:** An advanced relational database known for reliability, scalability, and support for complex queries.
* **MongoDB:** A non-relational (NoSQL) database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, ideal for dynamic or unstructured data.
* **Firebase:** A cloud-based NoSQL database that provides real-time data syncing, often used for mobile and web apps.

These technologies help back-end systems handle data securely, quickly, and reliably for dynamic web applications.
