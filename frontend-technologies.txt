**Front-end technologies** are the tools and languages used to build the part of a website that users interact with directly:

* **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** Provides the structure and content of web pages, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
* **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Controls the visual appearance of web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (JS):** Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites, such as animations, form validations, and content updates without reloading the page.

Together, these technologies form the foundation of front-end development, creating engaging and user-friendly web experiences.



**Front-end frameworks and libraries** like **React** and **Vue.js** help developers build dynamic and efficient user interfaces more easily than plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* **React:** A JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building reusable UI components and managing the state of complex applications efficiently. It uses a virtual DOM to update only the parts of the page that change, improving performance.
* **Vue.js:** A progressive JavaScript framework that is easy to integrate and focuses on building interactive and reactive user interfaces with a simple and flexible structure.

Both React and Vue.js enable developers to create **responsive, maintainable, and high-performing web applications** with less code.
