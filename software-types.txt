Software can be classified into several types based on their purpose. **System software** manages the computer’s hardware, while **application software** helps users perform tasks, and **programming software** enables developers to create programs. Other types include **middleware** that connects systems, **driver and utility software** that support device operation and maintenance, and **embedded and web-based software** that run within devices or through the internet.

Software is grouped into different types based on what it does. **System software** operates and controls computer hardware, while **application software** allows users to perform tasks like writing documents or browsing the internet. **Programming software** provides tools for developers, **middleware** connects different systems, **drivers and utilities** help run and maintain devices, and **embedded or web-based software** powers everyday gadgets or runs through a browser.

A **web application** is a software program that runs on a web server and is accessed through a web browser (such as Chrome or Firefox). Unlike traditional desktop applications, it doesn’t need to be installed on a computer—users simply visit a URL to use it. Examples include online banking systems, email services, e-commerce sites, and tools like Google Docs.

**Mobile applications** are software programs designed to run on smartphones and tablets. They are installed through app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store. Mobile apps can work online or offline and often use device features such as the camera, GPS, or sensors. Common examples include social media apps, messaging apps, games, and mobile banking apps.

**Desktop applications** are software programs installed directly on a computer’s operating system, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux. They run locally on the machine, allowing high performance and full access to hardware resources. Desktop apps typically work without needing an internet connection and are used for tasks like editing documents, graphic design, programming, gaming, and media creation. Examples include Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, and Visual Studio.
